In addition to an eviction moratorium, the city's ordinance:

* Restates that any rent increase that might violate the city's rent control ordinance is unlawful.
* Applies a moratorium on any late fees incurred during the emergency that arises from COVID-19, such as from a lost job.
* Applies a moratorium on commercial evictions that arise from non-payment of rent, if the failure to pay is due to a loss of revenue from COVID-19
* Bars evictions that arise from non-payment of rent. It isn't clear how this is different from the earlier provision that bars all evictions.
* Permanently amends the city's Just Cause eviction ordinance to bar any eviction that arises from the landlord's failure to accept rent paid out by a third party on behalf of a tenant
* Reiterates that tenants are not relieved of liability for back rends accrued during this time.
* Permits a landlord to temporarily reduce rents without affecting the base rent used in rent control calculations.
* Deems void any agreement by a tenant to waive any rights under the ordinance.
