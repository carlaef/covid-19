## Subjects Covered

Our first objective is to support the working class through plain english explanation of the rapidly developing legal situation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes, but isn't limited to:

* Eviction moratoriums
* Rent strikes, freezes, moratoriums
* Just Cause as applied today
* Employment and unemployment rights or benefits
* Meetings of public bodies under social distancing
* Wills, inheritance, and family inheritance law including the consequences of domestic partnership
* The legal implications of Shelter In Place and why breaking it would be a bad idea
* What is and isn't an "essential" industry

Our focus will be California, meaning federal programs probably won't get much written about them unless they have an effect on the golden state.
