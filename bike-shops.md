# Bike Shops

A common question is whether or not bike repair shops are considered an essential business under the statewide shelter-in-place order.

As of March 22nd, the state health department has released a [comprehensive list ](shelter-in-place.md)of what they've designated as an essential worker. Its a lengthy document and the only mention of personal transportation is this item:

> Automotive repair and maintenance facilities

This one is pretty clear: if you're a mechanic who fixes or maintains automobiles, your job is essential and may continue during the shelter-in-place order. There is no other mention of personal transportation in the document.

However, in that same Transportation industry section, we find the following three items:

> Employees supporting or enabling transportation functions, including dispatchers, maintenance and repair technicians, warehouse workers, truck stop and rest area workers, and workers that maintain and inspect infrastructure \(including those that require cross-border travel\)
>
> Employees of firms providing services that enable logistics operations, including cooling, storing, packaging, and distributing products for wholesale or retail sale or use.
>
> Taxis, transportation services including Transportation Network Companies, and delivery services including Delivery Network Companies

It is very possible to argue that a bicycle mechanic is an employee who is supporting or enabling transportation functions. This is more convincing if you consider that a bicycle courier is providing a logistics operation and this work must be supported by bicycle shops. It also seems rather straightforward to say that a bike courier is providing delivery services.
